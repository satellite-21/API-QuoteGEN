// Our quote generator will need to use the useEffect hook to perform a "side effect" 
// to fetch the quotes from an external API. After fetching our quotes, 
// we will put them in our local app state, which we will call quotes.

// We'll then take that array of quotes and use a function to select a random item within that array. 
// Then we'll put it in another state variable called just quote, which can then be displayed to our user.

// We also want to add a "New Quote" button above each quote that will perform the same operation â€“
//  get a new random quote from our quotes array and put it in quote.

// Finally, the quote isn't loaded in state. 
// So we'll make sure to use the optional chaining operator (?) to safely check our 
// object before we attempt to get a value from that quote in state to make sure our app doesn't throw an error.
